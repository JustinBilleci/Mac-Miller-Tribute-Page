            <ul id="tribute-info">
                <li><span class="bold">1992: </span>Mac Miller is born Malcom McCormick on January 19, 1992 in Point Breeze, Pittsburgh, PA.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2010: </span>Mac Miller releases his biggest project to date, "K.I.D.S"</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2011: </span>Mac Miller releases his first studio album, "Blue Slide Park" with it's undertones of "frat rap." although the album made Mac the first independant artist to top Billboard Top 100 since the Beatles, something no one since has been able to claim it came along with some heavy criticism for it's heavy reliance on "Frat Rap" and uninspired lyrics.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2012: </span>Mac Miller releases "Macadelic." A noticibly darker album that shows just how much the criticism of his last album affected him mentally and physically with the lyrics constantly hinting at drug abuse and depression.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2013: </span>Mac Miller releases "Watching Movies With the Sound Off." This dark and depressing album shows Mac almost giving up on life. A lot of the songs he recorded for this album were later used in the album "Faces" and Mac describes his thought process while making the songs stating that he genuinely felt like he was going to die.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2014: </span>Mac Miller releases "Faces." An album showcasing Mac's struggle with addiction and depression, considered by many to be Mac's best work.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2015: </span>Mac Miller releases "GO:OD AM." This album shows a more loose side to Mac as he raps about his achievements and successes in his career.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2016: </span>Mac Miller releases "The Divine Feminine." It only takes listening to one song on this album to know that Mac was in love when he wrote this. Releasing during his very public and sometimes tumultuos relationship with fellow artist, Ariana Grande. This album shows the importance of love and happiness in Mac's life, going as far as to make a song dedicated to his partner, "My Favorite Part." Showing a more vulnerable side of mac makes this one a personal favorite of mine.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2018: </span>Mac Miller releases "Swimming," a more calming and gentle side of himself. Going through a breakup and a DUI charge Mac almost seems hopeless with a bleak outlook on life. Some songs such as "2009" show a much more mature outlook on life and fame comapared to his early projects. This would be the last studio album that Mac would see release to the public as later this year he would die of an accidental overdosde due to drugs laced with fentanyl.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2020: </span>The Estate of Mac Miller releases "Circles." The latest and most likely final full studio album by Mac Miller was released by his family as they felt that he would want this album to be public. The album meant to be a pairing with the aforementioned "Swimming" creating a joint effort of "Swimming In Circles."Circles" is and almost uneasy oreshadowing of the late rappers death with the first words on the album being, "This is what it looks like, right before you fall."</li>
